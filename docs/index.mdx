# Why use this library

> [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) is a cool react component library and it's using [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss) as styling solution. The CSS injected by Material-UI to style a component has the highest specificity possible as the `<style>` is injected at the bottom of the `<head>` to ensure the components always render correctly. You need to change the order of the `<style>` injected by Material-UI if you want to override the it's default style.

This library is a wrapper component which only takes the children prop and renders it without any modification but just moving Material-UI's `<style>` tag to the top of the `<head>` tag. It will make overriding style very easy.

PS: OverrideMaterialUICss will add [CSS Baseline](https://material-ui.com/style/css-baseline/). It's provided by Material-UI to kickstart an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon. It's not a must have thing and you can disable this feature by setting `useCssBaseline` to false. Eg:

`<OverrideMaterialUICss useCssBaseline={false}> <button>testButton</button> </OverrideMaterialUICss>`
